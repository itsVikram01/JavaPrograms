Functional interface :
    A functional interface in Java is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method.
    It's also known as a SAM (Single Abstract Method) interface.


Real-world Use Cases
    . GUI development: ActionListener, Runnable
    . Data processing: Consumer, Function, Predicate
    . Concurrency: Callable, Supplier
    . Sorting and comparing: Comparator


Key Points to Remember
    . Functional interfaces are essential for lambda expressions and method references.
    . They promote a functional programming style in Java.
    . Built-in functional interfaces provide common abstractions.
    . Custom functional interfaces can be created for specific needs.
