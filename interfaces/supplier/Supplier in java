The Supplier interface in Java is a functional interface that represents a supplier of results. It doesn't take any arguments but produces a result of a specific type.

Key points:
    . Functional interface: Contains only one abstract method, get().
    . Returns a value: The get() method doesn't take any arguments and returns a value of type T.
    . Used for deferred execution: Often used to delay the creation of objects or values until they are actually needed.
    . Lambda expressions: Commonly used with lambda expressions to create Supplier instances concisely.


Common Use Cases
    . Lazy initialization: Deferring the creation of objects until they are actually needed.
    . Generating values: Creating suppliers for random numbers, dates, or other values.
    . Providing default values: Supplying default values for optional parameters or configurations.
    . Testing: Creating test data suppliers.

Additional Notes
    . Supplier can be combined with other functional interfaces like Consumer and Function for more complex operations.
    . The Optional class uses Supplier for providing default values.
