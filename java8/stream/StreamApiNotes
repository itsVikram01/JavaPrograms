Java 8 Streams:
    . A sequence of elements: Streams represent a sequence of elements, which can be processed in various ways.
    . Functional in nature: Operations on streams are declarative and functional, meaning they describe what to do rather than how to do it.
    . Lazy evaluation: Intermediate operations are not executed until a terminal operation is performed.

Additional Stream Operations:
    . Filtering: filter()
    . Mapping: map(), flatMap()
    . Reducing: reduce(), collect()
    . Sorting: sorted()
    . Matching: allMatch(), anyMatch(), noneMatch()




Why we need Stream???

1. Functional programming
2. Code reduce
3. Bulk Operation

methods :
1. filter : for conditional check
2. forEach : for iteration
