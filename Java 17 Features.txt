Java 17 Features :

1. Pattern Matching for Switch (JEP 406):
	This feature enhances the switch statement by allowing pattern matching directly within the case labels.
	You can use patterns (such as type patterns, null checks, and custom patterns) to simplify code and make it more expressive.
	Example:
	Java

	String result = switch (input) {
		case String s && s.length() > 5 -> "Long string";
		case String s -> "Short string";
		default -> "Unknown";
	};
	AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
	
2. Sealed Classes and Interfaces (JEP 397):
	Sealed classes restrict which other classes or interfaces can extend or implement them.
	Helps improve encapsulation and maintainability.
	Example:
	Java

	sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rectangle, Triangle { /* ... */ }
	final class Circle implements Shape { /* ... */ }
	AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
	
3. Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators (JEP 356):
	Provides new interfaces and implementations for PRNGs.
	Allows easier interchangeability of algorithms and better support for stream-based programming.
	Example:
	Java

4. IntStream randomInts = RandomGeneratorFactory.of("SHA1PRNG").create().ints(10, 0, 100);
	AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
	Foreign Function & Memory API (JEP 389):
	Enables interaction with native code and memory in a safer and more efficient way.
	Useful for integrating with libraries written in other languages (e.g., C/C++).
	Example:
	Java

5.MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(1024);
	AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
	Deprecation of the Applet API (JEP 398):
	The Applet API, used for embedding Java applets in web browsers, has been deprecated.
	Most modern browsers no longer support Java applets.
	Developers are encouraged to migrate to other technologies (e.g., JavaFX, web components).
