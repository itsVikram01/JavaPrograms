Adapter class :
		---------------
			Adapter class is a class which provide empty implementation of every method present in interface.

			interface MyInterface {
				m1();
				m2();
				.
				.
				m1000();
			}
			abstract class MyAdapter implements MyInterface {
				m1(){}
				m2(){}
				.
				.
				m1000(){}
			}
			class Test extends MyAdapter {
				m1(){
					//code
				}
			}
			class Dummy extends MyAdapter {
				m1000(){
					//code
				}
			}



			Withought using Adapter class :
			we have to provide implementation of every method of interface in every class which implements Interface.
			class WithoutAdapter implements MyInterface {
				m1(){//code}
				m2(){//code}
				.
				.
				m1000(){//code}
			}
